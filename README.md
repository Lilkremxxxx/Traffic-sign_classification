# Traffic-sign_classification
This project involves building a deep learning model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to recognize Vietnamese traffic signs. Developed with Python and TensorFlow, it processes both images and live camera input. The system displays the traffic sign’s name, the corresponding penalty based on vehicle type, and the model’s confidence level.
